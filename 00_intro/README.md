## 00. Introduction to PySCIPOpt

Welcome to SCIPDex! let's get started with the first exercise ðŸš€

### Exercise 1: Print SCIP version used
Go to [00_intro/print_version.py](print_version.py) and complete the TODOs.
You can look for the method to use in the [PySCIPOpt documentation](https://pyscipopt.readthedocs.io).


### Exercise 2: Create your first SCIP model
Go to [00_intro/first_model.py](first_model.py) and implement the following model:
```
maximize x + y
subject to
 x + y <= 1
 x, y binary
```

Refer to the [docs](https://pyscipopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/model.html#create-a-model-variables-and-constraints) for help.


### Exercise 3: Read and problem from a file
TODO! 

### Exercise 4: Query solution and model stats
TODO!

### Exercise 5: Set parameters
TODO! 

### Exercise 6: Setting emphasis modes
TODO!


### Outro
If you've reached this far, congratulations!ðŸŽ‰ 
By now, you should be able to create a basic model and query it.... 

You are now ready to take on Chapter 1, where we will be looking at modeling classic problems in the literature!
Check out the [README](../01_modeling/README.md) for the necessary information.
